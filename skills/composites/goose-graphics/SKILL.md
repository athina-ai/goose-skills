description: Portable visual skill pack for the Agent Skills ecosystem (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Claude Cowork, Claude Design, Goose, Cursor, Codex). Discovers community-published styles + formats via the gooseworks CLI, runs an extract-style workflow on reference images, and exports rendered PNGs via Playwright.
---

## 1. Overview

`goose-graphics` is a portable visual skill pack for the Agent Skills ecosystem. Styles and formats live in the central Gooseworks library — fetched on demand via `npx gooseworks` instead of bundled into this repo. The skill pairs that catalog with an extract-style workflow for reference images, an Unsplash + ASCII art image-sourcing layer, and a Playwright-based HTML-to-PNG export pipeline.

It loads in any host that reads `SKILL.md` — Claude Code agents calling it for automated render, Goose pipelines wiring it into content generation, Cursor/Codex projects picking it up via `.cursor/rules/` or `~/.codex/skills/`. Each style ships a slim DESIGN.md spec via `npx gooseworks styles get <slug>`, which can also be uploaded directly into Claude Design as a design-system scaffold.

Format templates, image-sourcing helpers, and the screenshot pipeline live in this skill pack. Styles, formats, and example renders are fetched on demand from the central library — no slugs are baked in.

## 2. Invocation

This skill supports **three invocation modes** — all-args, partial-args, and interactive. Pick the fastest path for the ask.

### 2.1 Full-args invocation (fastest path)

```
/goose-graphics --style <slug> --format <format> [--brief "..."] [--ref <image-path>]
```

- `--style <slug>` — any community-published style slug. Discover with `npx gooseworks styles list` / `search`. Required for style-selected generation. Omit to let the user pick interactively.
- `--format <format>` — any community-published format slug (e.g., `carousel`, `story`, `infographic`, `slides`, `poster`, `chart`, `tweet`, plus any community additions). Discover with `npx gooseworks formats list`. Required for format-selected generation.
- `--brief "..."` — the topic / content description. Replaces the Content Discovery phase.
- `--ref <image-path>` — if present, extract an ad-hoc style from the reference image for this single render instead of using a preset. When `--ref` is provided, `--style` is ignored. **For creating a persistent published style that other agents can discover, use the dedicated `/goose-graphics-create-style` skill instead.**

**Three branches:**

1. **All required args present** (`--style` + `--format` + `--brief` OR `--ref` + `--format` + `--brief`) → skip discovery, skip style selection, proceed directly to §7 (Set Output Path) and §8 (Generate HTML).
2. **Partial args** → ask only for the missing pieces. If `--style` is set but `--format` is not, ask only for format. If `--brief` is missing, ask only for the topic/content.
3. **No args** → run the interactive flow from §3 onward.

### 2.2 Examples

```bash
# Full args — one-shot generate
/goose-graphics --style matt-gray --format carousel --brief "How founders find their first 100 customers in 2026"

# Reference-driven — extract a one-off style from an image and build with it
/goose-graphics --ref ~/Desktop/mood.png --format poster --brief "Summer studio open house, August 14"

# Partial — Claude asks for the missing brief
/goose-graphics --style deep-ocean --format slides

# No args — full interactive flow
/goose-graphics
```

To **create a persistent published style** (slim spec + hero render + a few additional examples, pushed to the central library so other agents can discover it), use the dedicated `/goose-graphics-create-style` skill instead.

### 2.3 Defaults when args are partial but unambiguous

- If `--brief` is missing but clearly inferable from subsequent user text, don't block — proceed.
- If `--format` is missing, default to asking (there is no safe default across formats).
- If `--style` is missing and `--ref` is missing, ask — style is load-bearing.

## 3. Discovering styles and formats

Styles and formats live in the central Gooseworks library, not in this skill pack. **Always list or search before assuming a slug exists** — the catalog is community-driven and changes over time.

```bash
# List or search styles
npx gooseworks styles list
npx gooseworks styles search "warm editorial"
npx gooseworks styles list --mood "Organic & Warm" --tag warm

# Fetch a specific style's DESIGN.md (the slim spec) — pipe into Claude Design,
# or include in the agent context for HTML generation
npx gooseworks styles get <slug>

# Same shape for formats
npx gooseworks formats list
npx gooseworks formats search "vertical"
npx gooseworks formats get <slug>
```

When the user names a style or format, run `list` / `search` first, then `get` the spec for the chosen slug. Never assume a slug exists from memory — slugs come and go as the community publishes and retires entries.

## 4. Publishing your style

When the user creates a new aesthetic via `extract-style.md` (or via the dedicated `/goose-graphics-create-style` skill) and is happy with it, publish it to the community library so other agents and users can discover it:

```bash
cd <directory-with-rendered-examples>
npx gooseworks styles publish
```

The CLI expects a `gooseworks-style.json` manifest in the working directory plus the referenced PNG files. See **§13 Manifest format** for the exact shape.

### 4.1 Description-writing guidelines (load-bearing)

The description is what makes the style discoverable by AI agents searching the catalog. Treat it as a search index, not flavor text.

- **50–200 words, keyword-dense.**
- **Lead with mood + use case.** "Bold magazine-cover energy for product launches and event posters."
- **Mention typography signals.** "Massive condensed sans-serif headlines paired with a delicate body serif."
- **Mention palette signals.** "Rust orange + cream + near-black."
- **Mention industry / audience fit if relevant.** "DTC beauty, indie publishing, event flyers."
- **Avoid generic adjectives alone.** "Beautiful," "modern," "clean" mean nothing without concrete signals — pair them with palette, typography, or industry context.

### 4.2 Tag-writing guidelines

- **3–10 lowercase tags.**
- Cover: **mood** (warm, dark, energetic), **density** (sparse, dense), **formality** (corporate, editorial, playful), **era** (mid-century, y2k, retro), **industry-fit** (saas, dtc, beauty, finance).
- Skip tags that just restate the name.

### 4.3 Example count guidance

- **Hero is mandatory** — exactly one example marked `isHero: true`. Pick the format that best showcases the style.
- **2–3 additional formats recommended** so the directory tile shows variety.
- **Hero priority order** if you can render multiple: `poster > carousel > infographic > slides > chart > story > tweet`.

## 5. Publishing your format

When the existing community-published formats don't fit the user's canvas (e.g., LinkedIn banner 1584×396, story cover 1080×1920, event flyer 8.5×11in), use the sibling `/goose-graphics-create-format` skill to produce a format spec and at least one rendered example, then publish:

```bash
cd <directory-with-format-bundle>
npx gooseworks formats publish
```

Format publishing **requires at least one rendered example** — the backend rejects an empty `examples` array. See **§13 Manifest format** for the exact shape of `gooseworks-format.json`.

Description and tag guidelines for formats follow the same rules as styles (§4.1, §4.2), but lead with **dimensions + content density** instead of mood:

> "1080×1920 vertical canvas for Instagram and TikTok stories. Single-panel composition, 5-word title max, large hero image or stat. Use for quick announcements and engagement posts where the viewer scrolls past in 2 seconds."

## 6. Host compatibility

`SKILL.md` (this file) auto-loads on most Agent Skills hosts once the pack is installed at the right path. Claude Design is the one host that does not auto-load skill packs — instead, it consumes individual style files (DESIGN.md) one at a time via manual upload, fetched on demand via `npx gooseworks styles get <slug>`.

| Host | Install | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `npx goose-skills install goose-graphics --claude` | Lands at `~/.claude/skills/goose-graphics/` |
| Claude Desktop | (same install as above) | Auto-shared — Desktop reads `~/.claude/skills/` |
| Claude Cowork | (same install as above) | Built on Claude Desktop; same skill dir |
| Goose (Block) | (same install as above) | Auto-discovers `~/.claude/skills/` + `~/.config/goose/skills/` |
| Cursor | `npx goose-skills install goose-graphics --cursor --project-dir .` | Writes `.cursor/rules/goose-goose-graphics.mdc` |
| Codex (OpenAI) | `npx goose-skills install goose-graphics --codex` | Writes `~/.codex/skills/goose-graphics/` |
| Claude Design | `npx gooseworks styles get <slug>` → upload the resulting DESIGN.md via CD's "Create new design system" | Per-style DESIGN.md upload; no CLI sync |

## 7. First-Run Setup

Before first use, check whether the screenshot tool's dependencies are installed. Look for a `node_modules/` directory inside the `screenshot/` folder (relative to this skill file).

If `node_modules/` does **not** exist, run:

```bash
cd [skill-pack-dir]/screenshot && npm install && npx playwright install chromium
```

Replace `[skill-pack-dir]` with the absolute path to the directory containing this SKILL.md file.

## 8. Interactive Workflow

```
1. Discover Intent   --> What format? What content?
2. Select Style      --> Pick from the catalog or extract from reference image
3. Select Sources    --> Unsplash photos? ASCII art? None?
4. Set Output Path   --> Where to save exports
5. Generate HTML     --> Using format spec + style spec + sources
6. Screenshot        --> Playwright PNG export
7. Deliver           --> Present results with file listing
```

## 9. Step 1: Discover Intent

Ask the user what they want to create. Run `npx gooseworks formats list` to see the current catalog. The seven baseline formats are:

| Format | Dimensions | Best For |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **Carousel** | 1080x1080px per slide | LinkedIn, Instagram multi-slide posts |
| **Story** | 1080x1920px per slide | Instagram/LinkedIn Stories, TikTok, Snapchat |
| **Infographic** | 1080px wide, variable height | Social media, blog embeds |
| **Slides** | 1920x1080px per slide | Presentations, webinars |
| **Poster** | 1080x1350px | Instagram posts, event flyers |
| **Chart** | 1080x1080px | Single data chart graphic |
| **Tweet** | 1080x1080px | Tweet-sized square screenshot |

The community library may publish additional formats (LinkedIn banners, story covers, etc.) — always run `list` first rather than assuming the seven above are exhaustive. If none of the available formats fit the user's needs, suggest the `/goose-graphics-create-format` skill.

Once the user chooses a format, fetch its full spec:

```bash
npx gooseworks formats get <format-slug>
```

The returned `spec.md` (or content rules) describes layout, content density, and per-section content rules. Follow its **Content Discovery** phase to gather the topic, content, and any other format-specific inputs from the user.

## 10. Step 2: Select Style

If the user hasn't specified a style, point them at the full catalog so they can browse visually:

> Browse the style catalog at **https://skills.gooseworks.ai/styles** to see every published style with rendered examples.

Then run `npx gooseworks styles list` (or `search "..."` / `list --mood "..." --tag ...`) to surface relevant options inline. Present the candidates in groups by mood with their taglines so the user can pick.

The user may also say: **"I have a reference image"** — in that case, read `extract-style.md` (in this skill pack) and follow its workflow to derive a custom style from the provided image. That workflow ends in a publishable bundle (`gooseworks-style.json` + rendered PNGs) the user can publish via `npx gooseworks styles publish`. After publishing, continue the workflow from Step 3 onward using the new slug.

After the user picks a slug, fetch its slim spec:

```bash
npx gooseworks styles get <slug>
```

The returned DESIGN.md contains everything you need to generate: palette, typography, layout, do/don'ts, and ready-to-paste CSS snippets.

## 11. Step 3: Image Sources (Optional)

Ask the user: **"Do you want to include images in your graphic?"**

Options:

- **Unsplash photos** — Read `sources/unsplash.md` and follow its search workflow to find and embed high-quality stock photography.
- **ASCII art decorations** — Read `sources/ascii-art.md` and follow its workflow to generate and embed ASCII art elements.
- **Both** — Read both source files and incorporate both types.
- **No images** — Skip this step entirely. The graphic will use pure CSS/HTML styling only.

## 12. Step 4: Output Path

Ask the user: **"Where should I save the exports?"**

Default location: `./goose-graphics-exports/`

Within that directory, create a subfolder using this naming convention:

```
[YYYY-MM-DD]-[slugified-name]/
```

For example: `2026-04-17-q2-product-roadmap/`

## 13. Step 5: Generate HTML

Follow the chosen format spec's **HTML Generation** phase. When generating:

- Apply the chosen style's CSS variables, typography rules, color palette, and spacing system — the DESIGN.md returned by `styles get` has everything you need.
- Incorporate image sources (Unsplash URLs or ASCII art blocks) if the user selected any in Step 3.
- Follow the format spec's content density limits and structural requirements exactly.
- Write all HTML files to the output directory established in Step 4.

## 14. Step 6: Screenshot

Run the screenshot script to export HTML files to high-resolution PNGs:

```bash
node [skill-pack-dir]/screenshot/screenshot.js --format FORMAT --input INPUT_PATH --output OUTPUT_PATH
```

Where:
- `[skill-pack-dir]` is the absolute path to this skill pack's directory.
- `FORMAT` is the format slug (e.g., `carousel`, `story`, `poster`, or any community slug whose spec defines a renderer profile).
- `INPUT_PATH` is the directory or file containing the generated HTML.
- `OUTPUT_PATH` is the directory where PNG files should be saved.

## 15. Step 7: Deliver

Present the results to the user:

- List all generated files (HTML source files and PNG exports) with their file sizes.
- Provide the full path to the output directory.
- Suggest how to preview: open the HTML files in a browser, or view the PNG files directly.
- For carousels and slides, note the slide count and order.

## 16. Special Modes

- **"Surprise me"** — Pick the carousel format and a random style returned by `npx gooseworks styles list`. Ask the user only for content/topic, then generate everything else automatically.
- **Multi-format** — If the user says "make this as both a carousel and an infographic," run the full workflow twice using the same content and style but different format slugs. Save outputs in separate subdirectories.
- **Style preview** — Before committing to full generation, produce a single sample slide or section so the user can approve the visual direction. If they want changes, adjust the style or switch slugs before generating the rest.

## 17. Manifest format

These manifests are CLI inputs the user produces in their own working directory before running `publish`. They never live in this repo.

### 17.1 Style manifest (`gooseworks-style.json`)

```json
{
  "name": "Desert Sunset",
  "slug": "desert-sunset",
  "description": "Warm dusk gradients with rust and amber on cream paper. Editorial serif headlines paired with a single sans-serif accent. Built for DTC beauty product launches, lifestyle long-form, and event posters where you want a confident, sun-soaked, high-end magazine feel.",
  "designMd": "# Desert Sunset\n\n…full slim spec markdown — palette table, typography table, layout rules, do/don'ts, optional CSS variables block…",
  "moodGroup": "Organic & Warm",
  "tags": ["warm", "desert", "editorial", "serif", "dtc"],
  "palette": [
    { "hex": "#E06A2C", "role": "primary" },
    { "hex": "#3A1F1A", "role": "ink" },
    { "hex": "#F5EFE7", "role": "paper" }
  ],
  "examples": [
    { "format": "poster", "isHero": true, "file": "./poster.png", "caption": "Hero render" },
    { "format": "carousel", "file": "./carousel.png" },
    { "format": "story", "file": "./story.png" }
  ]
}
```

Field constraints:
- `name`: 1–120 chars
- `slug`: optional kebab-case `[a-z0-9-]+`; backend auto-generates if absent. A collision returns 409 with a `suggestedSlug` — the CLI handles re-submission.
- `description`: 20–1000 chars (**required**)
- `designMd`: minimum 50 chars (**required**)
- `moodGroup`: optional; one of `"Dark & Moody"`, `"Light & Editorial"`, `"Organic & Warm"`, `"Bold & Energetic"`, `"Retro & Cinematic"`, `"Structural & Technical"`, `"Friendly Corporate"`
- `tags`: array of strings (default `[]`)
- `palette`: array of `{ hex: "#RRGGBB", role?: string }`
- `examples`: array, **minimum 1 entry**, **exactly one** with `isHero: true`
- `examples[].format`: slug of an existing graphics format (any from `npx gooseworks formats list`)
- `examples[].file`: relative path to the PNG in the working directory

### 17.2 Format manifest (`gooseworks-format.json`)

```json
{
  "name": "LinkedIn Banner",
  "slug": "linkedin-banner",
  "description": "1584×396 LinkedIn profile background. Single horizontal banner; minimal text (4 words max), abstract backdrop, optional small logo lower-right. Use for professional brand presence.",
  "width": 1584,
  "height": 396,
  "contentRulesMd": "## Rules\n\n- Title: 4 words max, large display, top-left or center\n- No body copy\n- One brand mark optional, lower-right, ≤8% of canvas\n…",
  "tags": ["linkedin", "banner", "horizontal", "professional"],
  "examples": [
    { "file": "./example-1.png", "styleSlug": "matt-gray", "caption": "Paired with matt-gray" },
    { "file": "./example-2.png", "styleSlug": "neon-dashboard" }
  ]
}
```

Field constraints:
- `name`: 1–120 chars
- `slug`: optional kebab-case
- `description`: 20–1000 chars (**required**)
- `width` / `height`: integers, 64–8192
- `contentRulesMd`: minimum 50 chars (**required**)
- `tags`: array of strings
- `examples`: array, **minimum 1 entry** (**required** — the backend rejects empty)
- `examples[].styleSlug`: optional reference to which style was used to render the example
