## Skill Packs

Install a curated group of related skills with one command:

```bash
npx goose-skills install lead-gen-devtools

Packs install each sub-skill independently to `~/.claude/skills/<skill>/`. Packs can include their own skills and/or reference existing skills from the registry. Works with all platform targets:

```bash
npx goose-skills install lead-gen-devtools --codex

```bash
npx goose-skills install google-ad-scraper --claude
npx goose-skills install google-ad-scraper --codex
npx goose-skills install google-ad-scraper --cursor --project-dir /path/to/repo
```
